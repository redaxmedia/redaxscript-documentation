Continuous integration
----------------------

A bunch of frontend and backend tools run on [Travis CI](https://travis.redaxscript.com) and [Appveyor](https://appveyor.redaxscript.com) once a commit has been pushed.


Continuous inspection
---------------------

[Scrutenizer](https://scrutinizer.redaxscript.com) and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.redaxscript.com) are our weapons of choice to keep track on the quality of our codebase.
