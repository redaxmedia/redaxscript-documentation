Verify your webserver provides `PHP` 7.2.0 or higher. You can enable another version inside your `.htaccess` file:

```
addhandler php72-cgi .php
```

XAMPP ships the PEAR Config that causes a fatal error. Please uncomment the `include_path` inside your `php.ini` file located in the XAMPP directory:

```
include_path = ".:/php/includes"
```
